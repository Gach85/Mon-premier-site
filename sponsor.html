                <h3>Poppy the koala</h3>
                <p>Meet Poppy, aka “Miss Independent”. Born on the 29th of June 2019, she is a strong-willed, little
                    go-getter of a koala joey who can’t wait to be big and strong so she can go exploring. Poppy has
                    been melting hearts from the moment she left her mums pouch with her independent and feisty nature.
                    She’s a little koala with a big personality.</p>

                <h3>Spirit the eagle</h3>
                <p>Meet Spirit, the wedge-tailed eagle. Spirit was originally brought into care from the wild after
                    being struck by a car. His injuries meant that he couldn’t be re-released, but he still gets to fly
                    every day as one of the stars of our Free Flight Raptor Show. Spirit is a serious boy, but has a
                    definite soft side and likes the occasional head scratch from his keepers. Spirit arrived at Lone
                    Pine in November 2004.</p>

                <h3>Aroona the platypus</h3>
                <p>Aroona is one of our male platypus, born on the 1st of October 2012. Aroona is a speedy little lad,
                    both in the water and on land. He loves chasing crayfish in his tank, and always travels through his
                    burrow network in record speed, before snuggling up in his den for a nap. You can easily identify
                    Aroona by his smooth, perfectly brown bill, as opposed to Barak's which has pink pigmentation. Tune
                    in to watch Aroona in his exhibit 24/7 via our 'Webcams' tab.</p>
